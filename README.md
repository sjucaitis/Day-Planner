# Day-Planner

This simple planner application allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. The application runs in the user's brower, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story

A user with a busy schedule wishes to manage their workday time effectively by adding important events to a streamlined, responsive browser application.

The user opens the planner and the current date displays at the top of the page. Hourly time-blocks are presented to the user, which are color-coded to indicate whether the blocks are past, present, or future. The user can enter their event into their chosed time-block and click a button to save the event in local storage.
